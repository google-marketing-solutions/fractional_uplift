"""A module containing all the base models that can be used.

Base models are the fundamental ML algorithms used by the FractionalUpliftModel
to learn the uplift. These can be any ML classification algorithm, as long as 
it returns a score that can be interpreted as the probability of a sample
being assigned to a class.
